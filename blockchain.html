            <h2>Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Lawyers Leading the Way in Web3, Blockchain and DeFi</h2>
            <h3>
              Blockchain technology is changing the way individuals and companies transact business online. While blockchain opens new frontiers, it also presents many unknowns, and this has led to intervention and attempts to impose oversight by the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission), IRS, SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) and other federal authorities.
            </h3>
            <p>
              At this point, it is hard to believe that blockchain technology has only been around for slightly over a decade. Today, there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies worth billions of dollars in market capitalization (with Bitcoin leading the way by far), and blockchain technology is being used for everything from storing digital currency and recording transactions to providing digital identification. In the future, blockchain could play a significant role in online voting; and, if the growth in popularity of cryptocurrencies continues, it could become fundamental to multiple aspects of the worldwide economy.

              Yet, the technology still remains relatively unknown, and many of its uses are still likely to be discovered.

              However, this has not stopped federal regulators from getting involved. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have both taken positions on the legality of various uses of blockchain and various cryptocurrency-related transactions and market activities, and digital assets, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made clear that it intends to tax cryptocurrency as property—and aggressively pursue taxpayers who fail to report their cryptocurrency transactions. As a result, companies working with blockchain companies, cryptocurrency companies, cryptocurrency investors, and other individuals and businesses all need to be careful, and they need to seek experienced legal representation regarding corporate and securities laws before doing anything that could lead to civil or criminal enforcement action in this evolving regulatory landscape.

            <h3>Our Services: Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Compliance and Fraud Defense</h3>
            <p>
              We provide compliance and defense representation for all matters involving blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Regardless of your specific needs, if you are in need of legal advice or representation, we encourage you to contact us to learn what we can do to help. Some examples of our services in the areas of blockchain and cryptocurrency compliance and defense include:
            </p>
            <h4>Compliance Representation for Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency Transactions.</h4>
            <p>
              On the compliance side of securities and commodities laws, we advise clients and help entrepreneurs, investors, and companies avoid federal statutory and regulatory violations and mitigate other liability risks through the implementation of comprehensive policies and procedures, effective contract drafting and negotiation, and ongoing advice and representation. We provide these compliance services in the areas of:
              <p><span>Blockchain Technology</span>– For blockchain technology companies, we assist with navigating complicated, de-centralized, and rapidly-expanding federal regulatory regimes. We help company owners and executives make smart decisions, and we offer solutions that are flexible enough to adapt to blockchain companies’ rapidly evolving legal obligations.</p>
              <p><span>Smart Contracts</span>– Smart contracts have evolved quickly, but there is still a long way to go before they gain mainstream acceptance. We help companies create and utilize smart contracts supported by blockchain technology, and we represent our clients in federal regulatory matters when necessary.</p>  <p><span>Cryptocurrency Mining</span>– Cryptocurrency mining is a fundamental component of the expansion of blockchain, and it remains subject to close scrutiny at the federal level. Mining, especially on a large scale, potentially presents a host of legal and regulatory issues, and miners must ensure that their operations are fully compliant in order to avoid unwanted scrutiny.</p>

              <p><span>Cryptocurrency Transactions</span>– We advise and represent investors and companies with respect to all aspects of all types of cryptocurrency transactions. From cross-border issues to federal income tax implications, we help our clients see the complete picture so that they can make informed decisions.</p>
              <p><span>Cryptocurrency Forks, Halving, and Other Issues</span>Forks, halving, and other cryptocurrency events can present compliance concerns for cryptocurrency companies, exchanges, investors, and others. Here, too, we help our clients understand their obligations and make informed decisions focused on avoiding triggers for federal investigations.</p> 
              <p><span>General Corporate and Tax Compliance</span>– When establishing or running a blockchain company, cryptocurrency company, or other business that utilizes blockchain technology or digital currency, it is imperative to maintain general corporate and tax compliance as well. In addition to representing clients with regard to blockchain-specific compliance matters, we also provide comprehensive general corporate compliance representation.</p>
